              <h2>Who I Am</h2>
              <p>
                I'm an early-career developer transitioning from a hands-on military communications role into modern web development.
                My experience comes from <strong>college projects</strong> at UMGC and <strong>self-directed builds</strong>—shipping responsive UIs, React apps, and XR prototypes that focus on clarity, performance, and real user outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My Air Force background (Radio Frequency / SATCOM & Cyber) taught me disciplined problem-solving, systems thinking, and reliability under pressure. I bring that same mindset to software: plan carefully, communicate clearly, execute consistently.
              </p>

              <h2>Career Goals</h2>
              <p>
                My career goal is to establish myself as a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> who bridges technical excellence with practical business impact. I aim to work in organizations that leverage <strong>current and emerging technologies</strong>—including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and progressive web applications—to solve real-world problems in the digital media and computing industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm particularly drawn to roles where I can contribute to <strong>immersive digital experiences</strong>, whether that's building scalable web applications, developing AR/VR solutions for training and education, or creating interactive media that enhances how people learn and work. As the industry evolves toward spatial computing, AI-assisted development, and edge computing, I want to be at the forefront—continuously learning new frameworks, adapting to emerging best practices, and applying both traditional software engineering principles and innovative approaches to deliver user-centered solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Long-term, I aspire to take on <strong>technical leadership roles</strong> where I can mentor junior developers, architect robust systems, and drive projects that balance cutting-edge technology with maintainability and accessibility. I believe the future of digital media lies in seamless integration of web, mobile, and extended reality platforms, and I'm committed to developing the cross-functional expertise needed to excel in this evolving landscape.
              </p>

              <h2>My Approach</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Centered:</strong> Start with the problem, design clear flows, and build accessibly.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean & Maintainable:</strong> Semantic HTML, modern CSS, componentized React.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Delivery:</strong> Small milestones, visible progress, constructive feedback loops.</li>
                <li><strong>Team-First:</strong> Transparent status, proactive risk management, and ownership of outcomes.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I'm big on continuous learning—refining portfolio projects, exploring XR workflows, and staying active.
                I enjoy good food, travel, and building a disciplined routine that supports performance in and out of work.
