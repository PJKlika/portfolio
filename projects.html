              <h2>3D Donut</h2>
              <p class="project-category">Blender · 3D Modeling</p>
              <p>My take on the classic Blender donut tutorial, but with a 4th of July twist featuring red, white, and blue icing. This project was my introduction to Blender's node-based workflow. I spent considerable time perfecting the icing drips using physics simulations and getting the sprinkles to look realistic with particle systems. The challenge was balancing the whimsical patriotic theme while maintaining photorealistic materials. Learned shader nodes, Cycles rendering engine, and proper lighting techniques using three-point lighting setups. The final render took about 45 minutes per frame, but seeing that glossy icing with proper subsurface scattering made it worth the wait.</p>

              <p class="project-category">Blender · 3D Modeling</p>
              <p>Product visualization practice where I modeled a ceramic coffee mug with attention to realistic wear and surface detail. This project deepened my understanding of UV unwrapping and PBR (Physically Based Rendering) texturing workflows. I created custom texture maps including roughness, metallic, and normal maps to achieve the subtle imperfections you'd see on a real mug - minor scratches, fingerprint smudges, and slight color variations in the glaze. Used Blender's texture painting tools to add hand-painted details. The ceramic shader uses a mix of glossy and diffuse nodes with careful fresnel control to get that authentic pottery look. Great exercise in understanding how light interacts with different surface types.</p>

              <p class="project-category">Blender · Interior Design</p>
              <p>A complete bedroom interior showcasing environmental storytelling through props and atmosphere. Every piece of furniture and decoration was custom modeled - from the bed frame and nightstands to the books, laptop, and wall art. The real focus here was mastering lighting to create that moody late-afternoon vibe. I used HDRI environment maps for realistic ambient lighting combined with area lights to simulate window light casting across the room. Added volumetric lighting for subtle dust particles in the light rays. The scene includes normal maps for fabric textures, bump mapping for the wall surfaces, and careful attention to the Fresnel effect on reflective surfaces. </p>

              <h2>Apple Jumper</h2>
              <p class="project-category">Unity · C#</p>
              <p>My first complete game built in Unity - a 2D platformer where players jump through levels collecting apples while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Coded all player movement mechanics in C# including variable jump height based on button press duration, coyote time for forgiving platform edges, and smooth acceleration/deceleration. Implemented Unity's physics system with custom collision detection for platform interactions and enemy behavior. Created a simple state machine for enemy AI patrol patterns. Added particle effects for apple collection and player respawns. Learned about Unity's animation system, implemented background parallax scrolling for depth, and built a level progression system that saves player progress using PlayerPrefs. The trickiest part was getting the jump feel right - spent hours tweaking gravity scale and jump force values.</p>

              <h2>AR Flashcards</h2>
              <p class="project-category">Unity · AR Development</p>
              <p>An augmented reality mobile app that transforms physical flashcards into interactive 3D learning experiences. Point your phone's camera at a flashcard and watch as 3D models appear anchored to the real world. Built using Unity's AR Foundation framework for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android). Implemented image tracking to recognize specific flashcard designs and spawn corresponding 3D objects. The marker tracking was surprisingly challenging - had to optimize tracking stability by adjusting feature point detection and ensuring proper lighting conditions. Added touch interactions so users can rotate and scale the 3D models. Integrated text-to-speech for audio pronunciations and created a card deck system that tracks learning progress. Great intro to computer vision concepts and understanding how AR anchors work in physical space.</p>

              <h2>Planet Golf VR</h2>
              <p class="project-category">Unity · VR Development</p>
              <p>An educational VR experience combining space exploration with mini-golf gameplay. The experience starts in an immersive planetarium where you can teleport between planets, learning facts about each celestial body through interactive information panels. The scale representation helps users understand relative planet sizes. After the tour, you're transported to a Mars-like golf course where you use VR motion controllers to swing a golf club and hit flying saucers for points. Built with Unity XR Interaction Toolkit for VR controller input and physics-based club swinging. Implemented spatial audio for directional sound cues and optimized performance to maintain the 90fps required for comfortable VR. Created custom shaders for planetary atmospheres and designed the UI to be readable at various distances in 3D space. Biggest challenge was preventing motion sickness through careful movement design - used teleportation instead of smooth locomotion and maintained consistent frame rates.</p>

              <h2>Change Calculator</h2>
              <p class="project-category">JavaScript · HTML/CSS</p>
              <p>A practical web application that calculates change and breaks it down into the optimal combination of bills and coins. Built with vanilla JavaScript to practice fundamental DOM manipulation without framework dependencies. The app takes a payment amount and purchase price, then uses a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of bills and coins needed. Implemented input validation to handle edge cases like negative numbers and decimal precision issues. Created dynamic DOM elements to visually display the change breakdown with images of each denomination. Added event listeners for real-time calculation as users type. The math logic was interesting to work through - had to account for floating-point arithmetic quirks and ensure accuracy to the cent. Styled with CSS Grid for responsive layout across devices. Good foundation project that reinforced JavaScript basics and problem-solving through algorithms.</p>

              <h2>San Diego Top Spots</h2>
              <p class="project-category">Node.js · Express</p>
              <p>My first full-stack Node.js application featuring local San Diego attractions and hidden gems. Built the backend with Express.js, setting up RESTful API endpoints to serve location data. Implemented routing for different pages and used EJS templating to dynamically render content server-side. The locations data is structured in JSON format with details like name, address, category, and descriptions. Created middleware for logging requests and error handling. On the frontend, built an interactive interface where users can filter locations by category (beaches, restaurants, parks, etc.). Currently working on integrating the Google Maps API to display locations on an interactive map with custom markers. Planning to add features like user reviews and a favorites system with local storage. This project taught me the fundamentals of backend development - understanding the request/response cycle, setting up a server, and managing routes and middleware.</p>

              <h2>Mortgage Calculator</h2>
              <p class="project-category">React · JavaScript</p>
              <p>A React application that calculates monthly mortgage payments and generates a detailed amortization schedule. Users input loan amount, interest rate, and loan term, then the app calculates the monthly payment using the standard mortgage formula: M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]. Built using React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and side effects. Created reusable input components with controlled inputs and validation to ensure users enter valid numerical data. The amortization schedule breaks down each payment showing principal vs. interest over the life of the loan, with running totals for total paid and remaining balance. Implemented conditional rendering to show/hide the schedule. Used Chart.js to create a visual representation of principal vs. interest over time. The math formula was initially confusing - had to account for converting annual interest rate to monthly rate and loan term in years to months. Added responsive design with CSS flexbox so it works well on mobile devices. This project reinforced concepts of component composition and proper state management in React.</p>
